> **A cutting-edge educational notebook** demonstrating how Graph Neural Networks can learn atmospheric teleconnection patterns‚Äîthe long-distance climate connections that drive extreme weather events worldwide.

## üìö What You'll Learn

This notebook teaches you how to:

- ‚úÖ Represent the atmosphere as a graph network (nodes = locations, edges = connections)
- ‚úÖ Build Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial climate data
- ‚úÖ Learn ENSO teleconnection pathways automatically from data
- ‚úÖ Predict extreme events weeks-to-months ahead (subseasonal timescales)
- ‚úÖ Interpret GNN predictions through node importance analysis
- ‚úÖ Apply cutting-edge spatial AI to atmospheric science

**Perfect for:** Climate scientists learning GNNs, AI researchers interested in Earth science, students studying spatial deep learning, anyone curious about teleconnections and extreme weather prediction.

## üåç Background: Atmospheric Teleconnections

### What are Teleconnections?

**Teleconnections** are large-scale climate patterns that connect weather across vast distances. When something happens in one part of the world, it affects weather thousands of miles away.

**Famous examples:**

üåä **El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)**
- Warm water in tropical Pacific Ocean
- Affects weather globally: droughts in Australia, floods in California, warm winters in Canada
- Operates on seasonal-to-interannual timescales (months to years)
- Most important climate pattern for subseasonal prediction

üåÄ **North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)**
- Pressure difference between Iceland and Azores
- Controls European and East Coast winter weather
- Influences storm tracks and temperatures

üèîÔ∏è **Pacific-North American Pattern (PNA)**
- Links tropical Pacific to North American weather
- Major driver of temperature/precipitation extremes
- Critical for weekly-to-monthly forecasts

### Why Teleconnections Matter

**For extreme events:**
- üî• 2015-16 El Ni√±o ‚Üí Droughts in Southeast Asia, floods in South America
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è Strong NAO+ ‚Üí Mild European winters, cold eastern North America
- üå°Ô∏è 1997-98 El Ni√±o ‚Üí Record-breaking global temperatures

**For prediction:**
- Teleconnections provide **predictability** at subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales (weeks to months)
- Traditional weather forecasts: 7-10 days
- Climate projections: decades to centuries
- **The gap**: Subseasonal prediction (2 weeks to 2 months) where teleconnections matter most!

### The Problem Traditional Methods Face

**Linear correlation approaches:**
- Assume simple relationships between locations
- Miss non-linear dynamics
- Can't capture multi-step propagation (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC)
- Require manual feature engineering

**What we need:**
- Model the **network structure** of the atmosphere
- Learn **non-linear relationships** automatically
- Capture **multi-hop connections** (how signals propagate)
- Interpretable predictions (which locations matter?)

### Enter Graph Neural Networks

**GNNs are perfect for teleconnections because:**
- ‚úÖ Represent atmosphere as a **network** (graph)
- ‚úÖ Learn **spatial patterns** automatically
- ‚úÖ Capture **long-range connections** (not just nearby locations)
- ‚úÖ Model **information propagation** (how ENSO signal travels)
- ‚úÖ Provide **interpretable results** (node importance = influence)

## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### Why Graphs for Atmospheric Data?

**Traditional approach: Gridded CNNs**
- Treat atmosphere as regular 2D/3D grid
- Convolutional layers capture local patterns
- Good for spatial patterns, images

**Problem with CNNs for teleconnections:**
- Teleconnections are **long-range** (tropical Pacific ‚Üî North America = 10,000 km!)
- CNNs are **local** (small receptive fields)
- Need many layers to capture global connections
- Computationally expensive for global data

**Graph approach:**
- Nodes = locations (can be far apart)
- Edges = direct connections (even across globe)
- **One GNN layer** can connect distant locations
- Naturally represents atmospheric network structure

### Graph Neural Network Mechanics

**Message Passing (How GNNs Work):**

1. Each node has features (temperature, pressure, etc.)
2. **Aggregate**: Node collects messages from neighbors
3. **Transform**: Apply neural network to messages
4. **Update**: Node updates its representation
5. Repeat for multiple layers

**For teleconnections:**
- Layer 1: Each node learns from direct neighbors
- Layer 2: Nodes learn from 2-hop neighbors (neighbors of neighbors)
- Layer 3: Captures 3-hop connections (e.g., tropics ‚Üí subtropics ‚Üí mid-latitudes)

**Why this captures teleconnections:**
- ENSO signal (Node 0: Ni√±o 3.4) propagates through network
- Layer 1: North Pacific receives ENSO information
- Layer 2: North America receives information from North Pacific
- Layer 3: Eastern North America receives information from Western NA
- The GNN learns the **propagation pathway** automatically!

### Edge Construction Strategy

We create edges based on three criteria:

**1. Geographic proximity:**
```python
if distance < threshold:
    create_edge()
```
- Nearby locations influence each other
- Distance threshold: ~50 degrees lat/lon

**2. Known teleconnection patterns:**
```python
teleconnection_pairs = [
    (Ni√±o34, North_Pacific),
    (North_Pacific, Western_NA),
    (Western_NA, Central_NA),
    ...
]
```
- Based on atmospheric science knowledge
- Ensures physically realistic connections

**3. Historical correlation:**
```python
if correlation(temp_A, temp_B) > threshold:
    create_edge()
```
- Data-driven connections
- Captures relationships we might not know about

**Result:** Physics-informed graph structure!

### Multi-Task Learning Benefits

**Why predict ENSO + extremes together?**

1. **Shared representations**: Both tasks learn atmospheric dynamics
2. **Regularization**: Prevents overfitting to one task
3. **Efficiency**: One model instead of three
4. **Physical connection**: ENSO drives extremes, so tasks are related

**Loss function:**
```python
total_loss = loss_enso + 0.5 * loss_heat + 0.5 * loss_precip
```

ENSO prediction guides the model to learn large-scale patterns, which then help predict local extremes.

### Node Importance via Gradients

**How do we know which locations matter?**

We use **gradient-based attribution**:
1. Make a prediction for extreme heat
2. Compute gradient: ‚àÇ(prediction)/‚àÇ(node_features)
3. Large gradient = node strongly influences prediction

**Physical interpretation:**
- High importance for Ni√±o 3.4 ‚Üí ENSO is the driver
- High importance for North Pacific ‚Üí acts as bridge
- High importance for Western NA ‚Üí target region
- This matches known teleconnection physics!
